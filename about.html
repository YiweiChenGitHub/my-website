            <h1>About Me</h1>
            <p>Hi there! I'm Yiwei Chen, an immunologist with a passion for therapeutic antibody research. I currently call Zurich, Switzerland my home, where I'm immersed in the exciting world of immunology.</p>
            <h2>Background</h2>
            <p>My journey into immunology began during my masterâ€™s thesis in Fred Alt's lab, where I was captivated by the ability of B cells to design their own DNA to create antibodies. This curiosity led me to engineer humanized mice that produce broadly neutralizing antibodies against HIV. My quest for deeper knowledge brought me to Switzerland, where I joined Antonio Lanzavecchia's lab. Here, I delved into identifying remarkable antibodies capable of broadly recognizing malaria parasites. Now, I'm thrilled to be a part of Onur Boyman's lab at the University of Zurich and University Hospital of Zurich, where I continue my postdoctoral research.</p>
            <h2>Research Interests</h2>
            <p>I'm passionate about applied immunology, particularly in the design of better therapeutic antibodies. The adaptability of B cells and their vast library of antibodies fascinates me. My current research focuses on understanding Treg cells and their potential to suppress autoimmune conditions. My ultimate goal is to design therapeutic antibodies that amplify these cells in patients, helping those with autoimmune diseases feel better and live healthier lives.</p>
